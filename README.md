# 👋 Hi, I'm Justin Minnaar

### Building tech that matters—for people who need it most.

With over 40 years of experience in software development, I’m passionate about solving real problems with meaningful code. Right now, I’m focused on transforming digital payments and financial tools across Africa to help people in rural communities safely market and sell their products online.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🧒 Started programming at age 10 and still as curious and excited about tech as ever.
- 🧠 Built my first neural net in 1992. It took three days to evaluate a single output.
- 🏢 Listed my first company in 1998 and have helped launch over 10 software startups since.
- ⚙️ Worked across military, corporate, banking, insurance, and startup sectors, building software and leading dev teams.
- 🧪 Spent 5 years mastering test automation after falling in love with it 15 years ago.
- 🤖 Now integrating AI into development workflows and exploring new frontiers in software engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to speak Dutch and trying to understand the space-time effects for gravity.
